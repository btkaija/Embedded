% ARMSim
%
% I will run this driver as a script so that you can use the 
% command window to interact with the simulation as it 
% is running. Ultimately this would probably a function 
% with some other interface (e.g., a GUI).
%
% This script does three things:
%    1. Open a matlab figure for plotting
%    2. Open the serial connection to the WiFly on the ARM side 
%    3. Start a timer that queries over WiFly (think PIC on ARM side)
%

% 1. Open up a matlab plot window and get its handle
% We will pass the handle to the callback for the WiFly
% so that we can update the figure when we receive new sensor data
figure(1);
h = gcf();

% 2. Connect to WiFly and setup serial callback
% You will have to change this to agree with your WiFly
% Note that I have set up the WiFly to have a baud rate of 57600
ioARMSimWiFly = serial('COM6','BaudRate',57600);

% Note that we will pass the figure handle to the timer callback
% We will use this handle when we update our data plot
ioARMSimWiFly.BytesAvailableFcn = {@callbackARMSimWiFly,h};

% We use the character 'o' as a terminator. You will change this.
ioARMSimWiFly.terminator = 'o';
fopen(ioARMSimWiFly);

% 3. Create and start the ARMSimTimer object
% Note that we pass the WiFly serial object to the timer so
% that we can write to the WiFly from the timer callback
ARMSimTimer = timer;
ARMSimTimer.Period         = 2.0;
ARMSimTimer.ExecutionMode  = 'fixedRate';
ARMSimTimer.TimerFcn       = {@callbackARMSimTimer,ioARMSimWiFly};
ARMSimTimer.BusyMode       = 'drop';
start(ARMSimTimer);
